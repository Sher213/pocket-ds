# Pocket Data Scientist

A comprehensive web application that brings the power of data science to your browser. This application enables users to perform data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and reporting seamlessly.

CURRENT: The Prototype works in Streamlit and FastAPI, both located in ml-service directory. See instruction on how to run.

## Features

- 📊 **Data Import & Handling**: Support for multiple formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL)
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Interactive visualizations and statistical analysis
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Pre-built models and AutoML capabilities
- 📝 **Reporting**: Generate comprehensive analysis reports
- 👥 **Collaboration**: Share projects and results with team members (WIP)
- 📚 **Learning Resources**: Integrated tutorials and documentation (WIP)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Prototype in Streamlit
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Machine Learning**: Python with scikit-learn, TensorFlow

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pocket-data-scientist.git
cd pocket-data-scientist
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
```

4. Set up Python environment and dependencies:
```bash
